# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver

See the Readme in the folder RSolver for a full description of this program.

The folder "Notable Files" has the files in which most of my work was done. RubiksCube.cs is used for logic about manipulating the Rubik's Cube, and Solver.cs is used for logic about solving the Rubik's Cube.

To build and run this program, Unity must be installed (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). After it is installed, open the file RSolver/Assets/mainscene.unity.
